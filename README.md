# Kawaii-css v.001

Kawaii-CSS is a css framework for building "Kawaii cartoons". To explore the creative possibilities of CSS. An approach from a different angle that can hopefully generate more interest from novice developers.

There are no buttons, no forms, no font-sizes, no layouts, no grids, no responsive design media querys. Nothing that would help you build a website. Still interested?

##What is a Kawaii Cartoon?
"Kawaii" means "cute" in Japanese. Kawaii cartoons are painfully cute cartoon characters usually composed of simple shapes.*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii.

##What can you do with this framework?
Make cartoons. Switch out the eye, mouth, hair and costume classes to create your kawaii character. 

Customizing them is just as easy. Just place your CSS after the kawaii.css file and tweak to your heart's content.
